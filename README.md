# Henrique Pinheiro | VSCode Portfolio

My official personal portfolio, inspired by the VSCode interface, which makes it special. It was an exciting journey coding this project, utilizing React, Styled Components, React Icons, React Router Dom, i18next for internationalization, and file-saver for saving the resume.
